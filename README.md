# Video Broadcasting Analog Communication System using Vestigial Sideband (VSB)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves the development of a VSB-based analog communication system designed for the modulation and demodulation of video signals.Using **MATLAB**, the system simulates the transmission process by processing video frames, applying modulation techniques, and reconstructing the video at the receiverend

## 🚀 Key Features
**Frame Processing**: Extracts and normalizes RGB channels from video frames to prepare for transmission.
* [_start]**Modulation & Demodulation**: Implements Vestigial Sideband (VSB) modulation and applies demodulation by multiplying signals with a specific carrier signal[: 74, 75].
* [_start]**Video Reconstruction**: Reconstructs the video by reshaping demodulated signals and combining them into a final output file[: 76].
* [_start]**Signal Visualization**: Provides visual analysis of original, modulated, and demodulated signals for every channel to ensure system fidelity[: 77].

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* [_start]**Language**: MATLAB[: 72].
* [_start]**Modulation Scheme**: Vestigial Sideband (VSB)[: 74].
* **Core Workflow**:
    1. [_start]Extract RGB channels from source video[: 75].
    2. [_start]Normalize signal levels[: 75].
    3. [_start]Apply VSB modulation[: 74].
    4. [_start]Demodulate using carrier signal multiplication[: 75].
    5. [_start]Reshape and combine signals for final video reconstruction[: 76].

## 📊 Results
[_start]The system successfully validates the VSB communication model through the visualization of signal transitions and the generation of a reconstructed video file that maintains the integrity of the original source[: 76, 77].

## 📅 Project Timeline
* [_start]**Completed**: August 2024[: 73].
